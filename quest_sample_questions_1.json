			"hints": ["Remember the basic properties of a right rectangular prism. It has three distinct dimensions: length, width, and height.",
				"The volume of any 3D shape is a measure of the amount of space it occupies. For a right rectangular prism, the volume can be found by considering how many 1 cm³ blocks can fit inside it.",
				"To determine the volume of a right rectangular prism, you can use a specific formula that involves multiplying its three dimensions together.",
				"Use the formula V = l × w × h, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. Substituting in the provided values will give you the volume.",
				"Now, simply multiply 4 cm (length) by 9 cm (width) and then multiply the result by 10 cm (height) to find the volume in cubic centimeters."
